# Implementation of decision trees for classification and regression
The file dtree.py contains an implementation of decision trees for classification and regression comparable to scikit-learnâ€™s DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor using NumPy.
The file test_dtree.py contains a test script which is automated [here](https://github.com/weronicag/Decision-Tree-From-Scratch/actions) using github actions.
